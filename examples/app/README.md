To run the react example you need to instantiate the project, grab the library from github (using local copy was a little problematic)

## Install all libraries

```
`npm install`
```

(might need `npm i --force`)

## Install rbm-viz from git hub rather than local

```
`npm install git+https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/rbm-viz.git`
```

## Run the app

```
npm start
```

## Quit the live server

```
^C
```
